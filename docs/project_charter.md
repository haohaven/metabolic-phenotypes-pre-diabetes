When we think about metabolic health, it’s tempting to reduce it to simple numbers: glucose levels, triglycerides, waist size. People are often categorized as “normal” or “abnormal,” and interventions follow a one-size-fits-all approach. But the human body doesn’t always fit into neat boxes. Some individuals may have lipid driven risks, others glucose centric problems, and still others may struggle primarily with excess adiposity. These nuances are largely invisible under traditional diagnostic labels; but they could hold the key to more personalized care.

In this project, I set out to explore whether adults naturally cluster into distinct metabolic groups based on three widely available clinical measures: **fasting glucose, triglycerides, and waist circumference**. Rather than relying on rigid thresholds, I let the data speak for itself, applying **unsupervised machine learning** techniques—including KMeans, Agglomerative Clustering, and DBSCAN—to uncover patterns hidden within population-level health data.

The approach is intentionally hypothesis-generating. Instead of confirming pre-existing categories, I wanted to see whether the data would reveal **unexpected subtypes** of metabolic risk. Could we identify people whose primary risk is lipid-driven? Or those whose waist circumference signals hidden adiposity-related complications? Or even combinations that don’t fit conventional patterns at all?

The findings could have **real-world implications**:

-   **Personalized interventions:** Tailoring lifestyle or clinical strategies to the type of metabolic risk—weight loss, lipid management, or glucose control—rather than treating everyone the same.
-   **Better risk stratification:** Understanding which individuals are at higher risk for certain complications, beyond the classic metabolic syndrome criteria.
-   **Precision medicine potential:** Informing research and clinical practice with data-driven subtypes that may respond differently to therapies.
-   **A blueprint for other diseases:** Demonstrating how unsupervised learning can reveal hidden patterns in any health-related dataset.

Ultimately, this work is about **letting the data guide the story**. By moving beyond simple thresholds and exploring the natural clusters in real human data, we open the door to a more nuanced understanding of metabolic health. This isn’t just an academic exercise—it’s a step toward interventions and treatments that are as diverse and unique as the people they’re meant to help.

**Primary Research Question:**  
 Do distinct metabolic phenotypes exist within the adult U.S. population, characterized by unique patterns of fasting glucose, triglycerides, and waist circumference?

**Secondary Research Questions:**

·       **How many distinct metabolic clusters exist in the data?**  
 _Hypothesis:_ Based on prior knowledge of metabolic physiology, I expect 3–5 clusters to emerge, each representing a unique combination of metabolic risk factors.

·       **What are the clinical characteristics of each identified cluster?**

·       Do clusters differ primarily in glucose, lipids, adiposity, or combinations of these?

·       Are the clusters clinically interpretable and biologically plausible?

**3\. How do identified clusters compare to conventional metabolic syndrome definitions?**

·       Do data driven clusters align with ATP III criteria?

·       Do they reveal subtypes not captured by traditional binary thresholds?

**4\. Are cluster assignments stable across different clustering algorithms?**

·       Do KMeans, Agglomerative, and DBSCAN identify similar groupings?

·       Which algorithm produces the most clinically interpretable results?

**5\. Do demographic factors ; such as age, sex, or race/ethnicity differ across clusters?**

·       Are certain subtypes more prevalent in specific populations?

·       Could these insights inform targeted screening or intervention strategies?

By framing the analysis with these questions, the goal is to move beyond simple measurements and thresholds, and instead **let the data reveal the natural structure of metabolic risk**. Each cluster not only tells a story about physiology but also points toward actionable insights for clinicians, researchers, and public health practitioners.
